        <p>
        A web development course is a structured learning program that teaches the essential skills
            and technologies needed to create websites and web applications. It typically covers HTML and CSS
            for web page structure and styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and may delve into front-end and
            back-end development using frameworks and languages like React, Node.js, or Python. Students learn 
            about databases, version control, and development tools, with a focus on hands-on, project-based learning.
            Online courses and platforms offer a range of options
            for beginners and advanced learners, making it accessible to anyone interested in web development.
